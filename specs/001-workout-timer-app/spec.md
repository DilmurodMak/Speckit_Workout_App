# Feature Specification: Workout Timer App

**Feature Branch**: `001-workout-timer-app`  
**Created**: 2025-10-17  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I am building sleek looking workout timer app, where user can set multiple workout, with sets and times for each set of workout and the repetition quantity so user can have app that does this: example: I set three workouts (push up, sit up, pull up) I can have timer for duration of each workout (seconds), rest time between (seconds), and the total rep to repeat the same workout sets cycle."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create Custom Workout Routine (Priority: P1)

Users can create a workout routine by adding multiple exercises with individual timing configurations. This is the core value proposition - without this, the app cannot function.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of the entire app. Users must be able to define their workout structure before any timing or execution can occur.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a routine with 3 exercises (push-ups, sit-ups, pull-ups), setting 30-second duration for each, 10-second rest periods, and 3 repetitions. Delivers a saved workout configuration ready for execution.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user opens the app, **When** they tap "Create Workout", **Then** they see an empty workout builder interface
2. **Given** the workout builder is open, **When** they add an exercise named "Push-ups" with 30 seconds duration, **Then** the exercise appears in the workout list
3. **Given** one exercise is added, **When** they add two more exercises (sit-ups, pull-ups) with their durations, **Then** all three exercises appear in order
4. **Given** exercises are added, **When** they set rest time to 10 seconds between exercises, **Then** the rest time is saved for the routine
5. **Given** all exercises and rest times are configured, **When** they set total repetitions to 3 cycles, **Then** the complete routine configuration is saved
6. **Given** a routine is configured, **When** they tap "Save Routine", **Then** the routine is stored and named for later use

### User Story 2 - Execute Workout with Timer (Priority: P2)

Users can start their saved workout routine and follow along with visual and audio cues as the timer counts down for each exercise and rest period.

**Why this priority**: Once routines are created, users need to actually perform them. This is the primary use case after setup.

**Independent Test**: Load a saved routine (3 exercises, 30s each, 10s rest, 3 reps) and execute it. Timer should count down for each exercise, transition to rest periods, and cycle through all repetitions. Can be tested with a stopwatch to verify timing accuracy.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a saved workout routine exists, **When** the user selects it and taps "Start", **Then** the timer begins counting down from the first exercise's duration
2. **Given** the timer is running for an exercise, **When** the countdown reaches zero, **Then** the app automatically transitions to the rest period
3. **Given** the rest period completes, **When** the timer reaches zero, **Then** the next exercise begins automatically
4. **Given** all exercises in a cycle complete, **When** the cycle ends, **Then** the next repetition cycle begins automatically
5. **Given** all repetition cycles complete, **When** the final exercise finishes, **Then** the workout session ends with a completion message
6. **Given** the timer is running, **When** the user taps "Pause", **Then** the countdown stops and can be resumed
7. **Given** the timer is running, **When** the user taps "Stop", **Then** the workout ends and returns to the main menu

### User Story 3 - Visual Progress Tracking (Priority: P3)

Users see clear visual indicators showing current exercise, progress through the routine, and which repetition cycle they're on.

**Why this priority**: Enhances user experience but the workout can function without fancy visuals. Basic timer display is sufficient for MVP.

**Independent Test**: During workout execution, verify that the screen clearly shows: current exercise name, time remaining, current set number, total sets, rest/work indicator. User should never be confused about their position in the workout.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a workout is running, **When** an exercise timer is active, **Then** the screen prominently displays the exercise name, current time remaining, and "WORK" indicator
2. **Given** a workout is running, **When** a rest period is active, **Then** the screen displays "REST" with time remaining and the upcoming exercise name
3. **Given** multiple exercises in the routine, **When** viewing the workout screen, **Then** a progress indicator shows which exercise is current (e.g., "2 of 3")
4. **Given** multiple repetition cycles, **When** viewing the workout screen, **Then** the current cycle number is displayed (e.g., "Round 2 of 3")
5. **Given** a workout is in progress, **When** the user views the screen, **Then** a visual progress bar shows overall completion percentage

### User Story 4 - Manage Saved Routines (Priority: P4)

Users can view, edit, duplicate, and delete their saved workout routines.

**Why this priority**: Nice to have for long-term usability, but not critical for initial launch. Users can work with one routine initially.

**Independent Test**: Create multiple routines, verify they appear in a list, edit one routine's exercises and timings, duplicate a routine with a new name, delete a routine. All changes should persist.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple saved routines exist, **When** the user opens the app, **Then** they see a list of all their routines with names and exercise counts
2. **Given** a saved routine is displayed, **When** the user taps "Edit", **Then** they can modify exercise names, durations, rest times, and repetitions
3. **Given** a saved routine is displayed, **When** the user taps "Duplicate", **Then** a copy is created with "(Copy)" appended to the name
4. **Given** a saved routine is displayed, **When** the user taps "Delete" and confirms, **Then** the routine is removed from the list
5. **Given** edited changes are made, **When** the user taps "Save", **Then** the updated routine replaces the original

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user sets 0 seconds for exercise duration? (System should enforce minimum 1 second)
- What happens when user sets 0 seconds for rest time? (Should allow 0 for continuous workouts)
- What happens when user sets 0 repetitions? (System should enforce minimum 1 cycle)
- What happens when user creates a routine with no exercises? (Should prevent saving until at least 1 exercise is added)
- What happens when the device screen locks during a workout? (Timer should continue running and unlock should resume display)
- What happens when the user receives a phone call during a workout? (Timer should pause automatically)
- What happens when the user backgrounds the app during a workout? (Timer should continue with optional notifications)
- What happens when device battery is low during a workout? (Should show warning but continue)
- What happens when user has 20+ exercises in a routine? (UI should scroll smoothly)
- What happens when exercise names are very long? (Should truncate or wrap text appropriately)
