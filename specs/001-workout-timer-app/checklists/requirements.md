# Specification Quality Checklist: Workout Timer App

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is complete, clear, and ready for the next phase.

**Key Strengths**:
- 4 well-prioritized user stories with independent test criteria
- 24 specific functional requirements with clear constraints
- 12 measurable success criteria aligned with constitution standards
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Clear entity definitions
- 10 documented assumptions for context

**Suggested Next Steps**:
1. Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
2. Or run `/speckit.clarify` if you want to refine any requirements further

## Notes

The specification successfully balances:
- Mobile-first design (aligns with constitution principle II)
- Performance targets (aligns with constitution principle III)
- Accessibility requirements (aligns with constitution principle IV)
- Static web app architecture (aligns with constitution principle I)
