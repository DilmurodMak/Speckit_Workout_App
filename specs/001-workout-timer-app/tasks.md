# Tasks: Workout Timer App

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-workout-timer-app/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/components.md

**Tests**: Tests are NOT requested in the feature specification, so test tasks are NOT included in this breakdown.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
Based on plan.md structure: Single-page web application with `src/` at repository root

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup (Phase 1) completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) completion
- **User Story 4 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) completion - provides UI for US2
- **User Story 2 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) and ideally User Story 4 (for navigation)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 6)**: Depends on User Story 2 (Phase 5) - enhances workout execution UI
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Independent - can start immediately after Foundational phase
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Independent - can start after Foundational phase, provides home screen
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Soft dependency on US4 for navigation, but core timer logic is independent
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Hard dependency on US2 - enhances existing workout execution UI

### Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Phase 1 (Setup)** ‚Üí **Phase 2 (Foundational)** - MUST complete before user stories
2. **Phase 3 (User Story 1)** - Create routines functionality
3. **Phase 4 (User Story 4)** - Routine list and management (home screen)
4. **Phase 5 (User Story 2)** - Workout execution with timer
5. **Phase 6 (User Story 3)** - Visual progress enhancements
6. **Phase 7 (Polish)** - Final improvements and validation

### Parallel Opportunities Per Phase

**Phase 1 (Setup)**:
- T003, T004, T005, T006, T007, T009 can all run in parallel (different config files)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- T012, T013, T015, T016, T018, T019, T022, T023 can all run in parallel (different files)

**Phase 3 (User Story 1)**:
- T024+T025, T026+T027 can run in parallel (different atomic components)
- T028+T029, T030+T031 can run in parallel (different molecule components)
- T037 can run in parallel with component work

**Phase 4 (User Story 4)**:
- T043+T044 can run in parallel with T045+T046

**Phase 5 (User Story 2)**:
- T057+T058, T059+T060 can run in parallel
- T066, T070, T073 can run in parallel (different hook files)

**Phase 6 (User Story 3)**:
- T089+T090, T092+T093 can run in parallel

**Phase 7 (Polish)**:
- Most tasks in this phase are parallelizable (marked with [P])

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all atomic components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create Button component in src/components/atoms/Button/Button.tsx"
Task: "Create Button styles in src/components/atoms/Button/Button.module.css"
Task: "Create Input component in src/components/atoms/Input/Input.tsx"
Task: "Create Input styles in src/components/atoms/Input/Input.module.css"

# Launch all molecule components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create ExerciseForm component in src/components/molecules/ExerciseForm/ExerciseForm.tsx"
Task: "Create ExerciseForm styles in src/components/molecules/ExerciseForm/ExerciseForm.module.css"
Task: "Create ExerciseCard component in src/components/molecules/ExerciseCard/ExerciseCard.tsx"
Task: "Create ExerciseCard styles in src/components/molecules/ExerciseCard/ExerciseCard.module.css"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 4 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Create routines)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 4 (Manage routines)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test routine creation and management independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready - users can create and organize workout routines

### Full Feature Set (All User Stories)

1. Complete MVP (US1 + US4)
2. Add Phase 5: User Story 2 (Execute workouts) ‚Üí Test timer accuracy independently
3. Add Phase 6: User Story 3 (Visual progress) ‚Üí Test enhanced workout UI
4. Complete Phase 7: Polish ‚Üí Final validation
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Phase 1 (Setup) and Phase 2 (Foundational) together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Developer A**: Phase 3 (User Story 1 - Create routines)
   - **Developer B**: Phase 4 (User Story 4 - Manage routines)
   - After US1+US4 complete:
     - **Developer A**: Phase 5 (User Story 2 - Execute workouts)
     - **Developer B**: Can start Phase 7 (Polish) for completed stories
   - After US2 complete:
     - **Developer A** or **B**: Phase 6 (User Story 3 - Visual progress)
3. Stories integrate naturally without conflicts

---

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 133 tasks  
**Tasks per User Story**:
- Setup (Phase 1): 10 tasks
- Foundational (Phase 2): 13 tasks
- User Story 1 (P1): 19 tasks
- User Story 4 (P4): 14 tasks
- User Story 2 (P2): 32 tasks
- User Story 3 (P3): 13 tasks
- Polish (Phase 7): 32 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 60+ tasks marked [P] for parallel execution  
**Independent Test Criteria**: Each user story has clear validation scenario in phase header  
**Suggested MVP Scope**: User Stories 1 + 4 (create and manage routines) = 42 tasks after foundational work

**Constitution Compliance**: All tasks align with static-first architecture, mobile-first design, performance standards (60 FPS, <200KB bundle), accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), and browser compatibility requirements.
